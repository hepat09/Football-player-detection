# Football-player-detection
 Detection of football players on the pitch using YOLO networks.

The YOLO network is used to detect players ('person') on videos. Transfer learning is used to train the model, reaching more accurate predictions.
38 images were saved and labelled 'by hand' (using labelImg https://tzutalin.github.io/labelImg/). The training's main steps (notebook 'Object custom detection') followed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTCmL3S4Obw.

The results (detections) are displayed and output videos are saved using notebook 'yolo_realtime_01.ipynb'.

Note: networks weights can not be uploaded due to size limit: retrain should be preformed.
